# Sentiment Classification on Movie Reviews using CNN and LSTM

This project builds and evaluates deep learning models to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Objectives
- Load, clean, and preprocess raw IMDB review data
- Tokenize and pad sequences
- Build and compare CNN and LSTM-based deep learning models
- Use callbacks such as early stopping and learning rate reduction
- Evaluate model accuracy and analyze review length distribution

## Key Techniques
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- CNN and LSTM architectures using Keras
- Review length histogram analysis
- Label encoding, sequence padding, vocabulary building
- Performance evaluation on holdout test set

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Regular expressions, os

## Dataset
- IMDB sentiment review dataset split into `pos/` and `neg/` directories
